<h1 align="center"> Case Study For Alictus </h1>
    
    In this study i have been asked to clone 6 minigames of the games published by Alictus

<h1 align="center"> Summary </h1>

    This was a pretty helpfull study for me. I have learned the basics of masking in 3d. I used masking on 2d and ui before but this was my first time using it in 3d. It was a great way to test myself to see what i am capable of as well. This really helped me to realize my knowledge and lack of knowledge quite quickly.

<h1 align="center">GAME 1 : SUMMER BUSTER / RING STACK MINIGAME</h1>

</p>


    This was the first minigame i started cloning. I use stack data structure to make this minigame. I use pop method to get the rings from selected bodies and used push to drop onto them. To make ghost rigns i push a transparent ring into a stack while still holding the correct ring above it but when player decides to drop the ring ghost gets poped immediately. 

<h1 align="center">GAME 2 : AFFEARS 3D : SILLY SECRETS / MIRROR SELFIE MINIGAME</h1>

</p>

    This was my last minigame because i was intimidated by the fact that game could have include mirrors. But it didn't. So i made a starting chat animation and after that gameplay objects gets set actived. I made an arrow spawner to make rhythm randomized. After 4 correct swipes game gets completed and restarts. 

<h1 align="center">GAME 3 : ROB MASTER 3D / LASER DODGE MINIGAME</h1>

</p>

 
    This was the second project and it was pretty straight forward i just stopped the movement of player when the encounter is close enough and give tools to make body fit in the gap. After all 4 body parts were safe game continued automatically.

<h1 align="center"> GAME 4 : DEEP CLEAN INC. 3D / CHEESE PUFF CLEANING MINIGAME </h1>

</p>

    This was probbably the easiest minigame cause it didn't involve any scripting at all. I just made the vacuum move and put a collector on the nose.

<h1 align="center"> GAME 5 : MONEY BUSTER / FAKE MONEY MINIGAME </h1>

<p align="center">

</p>

    This was a slightly harder one because it did actually involve advanced masking. I needed to make two mask objects that masks the money but in different ways. But i figured it out by making mask layers dynamic and controlled by the tool player currently holds.

<h1 align="center"> GAME 6 : ASMR STUDIO 3D / SOAP CUTTING MINIGAME </h1>

</p>


    Well this was pretty much the same as game 5 but easier. I didn't need any dynamic masking or else. I just put a mask to knife and make it move only forwards. When player finishes a layer knife teleports all the way back and down a layer.
