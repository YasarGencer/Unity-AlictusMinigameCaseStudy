## Case Study For Alictus
In this study i have been asked to clone 6 minigames of the games published by Alictus

### GAME 1 : SUMMER BUSTER / RING STACK MINIGAME
[![Game1](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/AR8LFe7IAzVP-YXXEIaU8d4EjhbYOL3dk7_d_0YQhvQOww14PlDm3bxUsMBDiMk1Odc=w240-h480 "Game1")](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cg.waterbuster&gl=TR "Game1")

This was the first minigame i started cloning. I use stack data structure to make this minigame. I use pop method to get the rings from selected bodies and used push to them. To make ghost rigns i push a transparent ring into a stack while still holding the correct ring above it but when player decides to drop the ring ghost gets poped immediately. 
### GAME 2 : AFFEARS 3D : SILLY SECRETS / MIRROR SELFIE MINIGAME
[![Game2](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/5NzDWrIb0CP9udtEUDCNvxJ-X484Q8EslT8YA0ugyBIwm1pPTKorAD0_34JmTwdIXtw=w240-h480-rw "Game2")](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sk.babymatch&gl=TR "Game2")

This was my last minigame because i was intimidated by the fact that game could have include mirrors. But it didn't. So i made a starting chat animation and after that gameplay objects gets set actived. I made an arrow spawner and to spawn randomized rhythm. After 4 correct swipes game gets completed and restarts. 
### GAME 3 : ROB MASTER 3D / LASER DODGE MINIGAME
[![Game3](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/01s-9ocxbPi60tys9QU0LSGXytfhq0GcyGlOyT0-q9QH-nUXhzKBTWAHV7909WJOOss7=w240-h480-rw "Game3")](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ei.robmaster3d&gl=TR "Game3")

This was the second project and it was pretty straight forward i just stopped the movement of player when the encounter is close enough and give tools to make body fit in the gap. After all 4 body parts were safe game continued automatically.
### GAME 4 : DEEP CLEAN INC. 3D / CHEESE PUFF CLEANING MINIGAME
[![Game4](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/PNByXMfKLyAGityiBXYnXBJPfOh93LK9gavG_Iwj9FJ6PglcX0-D0BS8H_bNkrNIjRQb=w240-h480-rw "Game4")](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smo.deepcleaninc3d&gl=TR "Game4")

This was probbably the easiest minigame cause it didn't involve any scripting at all. I just made the vacuum move and put a collector on the nose.
### GAME 5 : MONEY BUSTER / FAKE MONEY MINIGAME
[![Game5](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/egaLifO_LOfhqbsQTfhpE1j-iwA0KnhONmF1kaf_Yl6BX9MP6DjTql_v6J9HHgtcT915=w240-h480-rw "Game5")](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cg.moneybuster&gl=TR "Game5")

This was a slightly harder one because it did actually involve advanced masking. I needed to make two mask objects mask the money but in different ways. But i figured it out by making mask layers dynamic and controlled by the tool player currently holds.
### GAME 6 : ASMR STUDIO 3D / SOAP CUTTING MINIGAME
[![Game6](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/R1lo_i5Sq6RfMZdm6QQmVLGV9su0zElufUTH9u7pVvJQAHCUq-1z_aexoJW1FSzsXT0=w240-h480-rw "Game6")](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sk.sander3D&gl=TR "Game6") 

Well this was pretty much the same as game 5 but easier. I didn't need any dynamic masking or else. I just put a mask to knife and make it move only forwards. When player finishes a layer knife teleports all the way back and down a layer.
